CrBoy's Dotflies
================
`Author: CrBoy (http://github.com/CrBoy)`

Introduction
------------
Here's some of my dotfiles in usual. A dotflie means those files begin with a `.`, e.g. `.zshrc`, `.screenrc`, or `.vimrc`. They usually stand for a configuration of some software.

I like to use zsh as my shell on Linux and MacOSX. As a C/C++ programmer, I use ctags to create databases for my code. Other dotfiles are also helpful to me. ;)

If [git] is installed on the machine, these settings could be installed by only one step on most of Unix-like OS.

[git]: http://git-scm.com/

One-Step Install
----------------
**Prerequisite: Make sure GIT is installed**

Using curl (MacOSX should have curl):

	curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrBoy/dotfiles/master/one-step-install.sh | sh

or wget (Linux often has wget):

	wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrBoy/dotfiles/master/one-step-install.sh | sh

----------------
- [Aminzai] and [mrmoneyc] shared their zshrc to me and give me guide on zsh.
- The gdb/stl\_views is from <http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/GDB-Commands.html>. It's a good utility for print out STL containers.
